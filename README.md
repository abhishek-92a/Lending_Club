# Project Name
> Using the principles of EDA, Python predict the creditworthiness of a loan applicant by analyzing a labelled dataset of bank customers and use the model to decide on loan approvals for new applicants.




<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## General Information
- Use the concepts of Univariate and bivariate analysis to explore what factors of a customer will influence their creditworthyness to decide if the bank can approve / reject / partial approval with high interest rate
- A very common problem faced by the banking industry whuch can leverage EDA to answer if a loan application can be accepted or rejected
- Make a recommendation engine to identify and classify risky loan applicants for accepting (full loan or Partial loan) or rejecting loan applicants
- loan.csv with 111 columns related to the existing customer who are either - Paid, paying or defaulted their loans

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
## Conclusions
- Customers who have maxed out their credit utilization (high %) are more likely to default.
- Most of the loan defaults are occurring under debt consolidation category.
- Majority of loan defaults are happening in the case of applicants whose annual income < 20000
- We can infer that lower value loans has a higher probability of being charged off.
Especially true for loan amounts between 2500 to 7500 with the average loan amount being 5000
- Most of the loan defaults are by applicant who are living in rented homes
